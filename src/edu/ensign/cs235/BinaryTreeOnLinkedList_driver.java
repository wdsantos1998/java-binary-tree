    Description:    BinaryTreeOnLinkedList driver


    I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write this program, such that I could
    throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely manner. I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand,
    describe, or recreate. I further acknowledge that I contributed substantially to all code handed in and vouch for
    its authenticity. (Daniel Oliveira)
